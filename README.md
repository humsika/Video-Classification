# Video Classification using Deep Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project implements a video classification model using deep learning to improve accuracy over traditional title-based classification methods. This model addresses misclassification issues common with the vast number of videos uploaded daily on the internet. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, the system classifies videos into predefined categories with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Utilizes deep learning to achieve higher accuracy in video classification compared to title-based methods.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Incorporates ResNet50 for feature extraction and a custom dense layer architecture for classification.
- **Real-time Processing**: Classifies video content in real-time using pre-trained deep learning models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure
- `code.py`: Contains the main script for training the model, including data preprocessing, model setup, and training.
- `video_classification.py`: Script for applying the trained model to classify new video data in real-time.
- Data and model files are stored in specified directories (adjust paths as necessary for your setup).
